        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
        <p>Welcome to a visual journey through motion and light — this website is a 🌙 parallax scrolling experience built to
        mesmerize and engage. From the moment you land, you're drawn into a dreamy world where stars glide, the moon glows, and
        mountains shift with your scroll.</p>
        
        <p>At the top, you'll find a clean and modern navigation bar 🧭 featuring a bold logo and smooth links like Home, About,
        Work, and Contact. Each link responds to your interaction with a soft hover effect, giving the entire experience a
        polished, interactive feel. It’s simple, intuitive, and helps you explore the site effortlessly.</p>
        
        <p>As you scroll down, the magic begins. Layers of imagery — ✨ twinkling stars, 🌕 a radiant moon, and ⛰️ mountain ranges —
        blend and move to create depth and motion. These elements aren't just placed randomly; they're carefully layered with
        creative CSS techniques and ready for animation, inviting users to explore further.</p>
        
        <p>Right in the heart of the scene is the bold title: Moon Light 🌠. Below it lies a glowing call-to-action button —
        Explore 🚀 — urging you to dive into the experience. This section sets the tone for the rest of the site: immersive,
        bold, and visually stunning.</p>
        
        <p>Below the parallax scene, you'll find more than just a pretty interface. The content section 💬 introduces real text and
        meaningful information. Here, you can share your story, highlight your creative projects, or provide an introduction to
        your brand or purpose. It’s designed to be clean and readable, blending seamlessly with the visual theme above.</p>
        
        <p>This site isn't just a design — it’s an experience. It combines 🎨 aesthetic beauty, 🧠 smart layout, and ⚙️ modern web
        technologies to create something truly memorable. Whether you're a developer, a designer, a storyteller, or a dreamer,
        this site layout gives you the canvas to express yourself with elegance.</p>
        
        <p>So go ahead — scroll through the stars, wander through the moonlight, and step into a world where creativity meets code.
        🌌✨</p>
